# ajax-weather-api
### What?
A weather app where you can see the weather for a city of your choice.

### Why?
This is an asignment for a cource I'm following
https://github.com/becodeorg/atw-giertz-3-23/tree/master/2.The-Hills/js/weather-app

### How?

1. download or clone the repository
2. make a new file in the repository called "config.js"
3. make an account on [this](https://openweathermap.org) website and copy your api key
4. copy this code and replace MY_KEY with your key

                const config = {
                    API_KEY: "MY_KEY"
                }
                
5. open the index.html in your browser and there you go

#### Updates

- got a key for the api and made shore it doesn't show in my code
- finished the fetsh to get the data that needs to be shown
- struggled a bit with making a class and loging it in the console
- figured out that i need to use another name for the varriable then the name of the class
